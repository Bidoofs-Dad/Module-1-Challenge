# Project Horiseon

## What Was Done

I went through both the CSS and HTML file, cleaning up quite a bit of the code, such as deleting unnecessary lines of code and condensing different "class" tags. The examples of condensing that I did, were as follows;

* ".benefit-lead", ".benefit-brand", and ".benefit-cost" were condensed into the class ".benefit-trio"

* ".search-engine-optimization", ".online-reputation-management", and ".social-media-marketing" were condensed into the class "seo-orm-smm"

I also removed a couple of unnecessary classes, reverting them to just their normal tags. They were;

* ".header"

* ".footer"

I also noticed that none of the images had an "alt" tag, so I went through and added one to each image, providing a brief description.

Another part I cleaned up was clearing up a bit of the "div soup" as it has been called. I edited a number of the "div" tags into "section" tags, as to make the code look a tad more appealing.

As for the CSS document, I also rearranged the code to follow the "cascading" format in a better fashion. As well as adding a few comments inside of the CSS to describe certain lines a little more.
